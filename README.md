⏱️ Start, Pause, and Reset Functions: Users can easily control the stopwatch with intuitive start, pause, and reset buttons.
⏲️ Lap Time Tracking: I added functionality to record and display lap times, making it perfect for tracking intervals.
🌐 Interactive and User-Friendly Design: Leveraging the power of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality, I created an application that is both interactive and easy to use.
